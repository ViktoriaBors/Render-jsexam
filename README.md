# SpaceRock - EXAM PROJECT
## ProOktatas Full-stack Developer bootcamp - JAVASCRIPT MODULE

### **_Introduction_**
During the 4 months Javascript module, I have learned the basics and more of vanilla Javascript. End of the course I feel I have a good understanting about this language and ready to develop more (Pppsstt it is going to be React).

In this exam project, there were some requirements. The project needed to be a CRUD app with a database connection. 

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. Tailwind Css and Tailwind Elements
2. Node Js / Express JS
3. MongoDB

## **_The project itself_**
The project idea is based on the ESA SACF https://sacf.esa.int/ . It is the European Space Agency Curator Facility and I am lucky to say I know some amazing people from there. I enjoyed to work on this project as it was a match with my geology degree.

**Aim of the Project**

To make a simple CRUD application where the user can add, modify and delete data (which is connected to a database). I also added pagination, a register and login site (using cookies) and a image uploading feature.

**Challenges within the Project**

This project was filled with challenges. I am not sure where I should even start. Luckily I have made some notes and posts about my struggles on my Linkedin. I also added my blog entries here under the **BLOG.MD**. 

## **_What have I learned_**
1. Javascript -  a lot. Front end and back end side too. 
2. MongoDB
3. Tailwind Css and Tailwind Elements

## Deployed: 2022. September.
